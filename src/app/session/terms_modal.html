        A Terms of Service Agreement is a set of regulations that users must agree to follow in order to use a service. Terms of Use is often named Terms of Service and sometimes Terms and Conditions, as well as Disclaimer, mostly when addressing website usage.

        If your website or mobile apps allows users to create content and make the content publicly available to other users, a Content section can inform users that they own the rights to the content they created and posted on your website or mobile app.

        Usually, the Content clause should mention to users that they must give you (the website or mobile app developer) a license so that you can share this content on your website/mobile app, to make it available to other users.
      </p>

      <p>
        Because the content created by users is public to other users, a DMCA Notice (or Copyright Infringement for non-US businesses) section is helpful to inform users and copyright authors that, if any content is found to be copyright infringement, you will take down the content and respond to any DMCA take down notices received.
